# Problem 1: Subsequence
# Write a function is_subsequence() that takes in a list of integers lst and a list of integers sequence as parameters. 
# Given these two lists, determine whether the sequence list is a subsequence of the lst list. A subsequence of a list is a 
# set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent but are in the same relative order as they appear in the list. Return True if 
# sequence is a subsequence, and False otherwise.

# def is_subsequence(lst, sequence):
#     pass
# Example Usage:

# lst = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
# sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]
# print(is_subsequence(lst, sequence))

def is_subsequence(lst, seq):
    pass
